|------|------------| 
|1. Download `nctf_bakup.dd` to your preferred location.<br>Based on the extension [`dd`](https://qiita.com/gpmrh096/items/70dfdf2a36c0de96d16d), it is a bit-by-bit copy of a disk partition.<br>As planned, inspect the file using WSL or a VM.<br>`file nctf_bakup.dd`<br><br>From the result, the format is Windows [NTFS](https://e-words.jp/w/NTFS.html).|<img width="700" height="74" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4887713-f3a6-4de7-bbc2-6c5b08d65fb3" />|
|2. There are many ways to analyze this file. This time use FTK Imager.<br>First, add an evidence item and select *image file* as the source, then browse and choose `nctf_bakup.dd`.|<img width="645" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86d95598-d4f4-417e-b2a3-0fddff9d4bc7" /><img width="504" height="235" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb1259f1-2e9f-4c28-9c67-7d6755a1cee4" />|
|3. Expanding the evidence tree, a suspicious ZIP file was found inside a JPEG file.<br>Export this file to your preferred location.<br>This file is a kind of [ADS](https://qiita.com/minr/items/c2393f532b2df35f7a9d) (*Alternate Data Stream*), which can hide data inside a file.|<img width="297" height="292" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06c4f851-ea17-44b0-b2f1-3463791b9819" /><img width="619" height="145" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf7b3fc3-4784-4632-8c89-a157ca8f3d20" />|
|4. Now, open the ZIP file, but it is protected by a password.<br>It is time to crack using [zip2john](https://omomuki-tech.com/archives/813).<br>`zip2john f14g.zip > pw.hash` â€»pw.hash is in a format available for John the Ripper.<br>Then, where is the password list? Try searching the same PC, maybe it exists inside `nctf_bakup.dd`.<br>While searching, you found a suspicious file.<br>Export this file and letâ€™s try to analyze *pw.hash* again.|<img width="979" height="556" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3607c77-28f9-43c9-ac69-761f6cbba08f" />|

|4. Then read the flag.<br>`cat '$RECYCLE.BIN/$RFOEVGE.txt'` <br><br>ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You found the flag.<br>â€»Remember to umount.<br>sudo umount /mnt|<img width="552" height="67" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f035e0c5-0442-4a7f-8187-b9fd8fc194d1" />|
